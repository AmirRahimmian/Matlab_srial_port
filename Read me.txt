This code is written for saving data through the serial port.

Serial port must be set in the code (s=serial('COM3');) : it can easily be found in the control panel-> Device manager-> (USB controller)

s.BaudRate=115200; have set based on my board setting.


Both the STM32 serial port and Arduino boards have been tested successfully.
